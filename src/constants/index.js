      "I worked with Edrick on a digital mapping project for cemetery navigation and record management. While I focused on 3D renders and walkthroughs, he developed the website and later transformed it into a fully functional app. His contributions went beyond just coding, he designed intuitive layouts, implemented smooth transitions, and built the core functionality that made the platform efficient and user-friendly. His ability to turn abstract ideas into a working system was impressive, and his dedication to the project was evident throughout. I highly recommend him as a reliable and skilled developer.",
